This project is hand-edited, for models & venv.  It runs.

Same *generated* project runs, many creation errors.  This is to analyze why.  Dialects are a likely factor.

Observations:

    Gen models missing:

        t_sqlite_sequence table

        import NullType

        OrderDetailList = relationship('OrderDetail', cascade='all, delete', cascade_backrefs=False, backref='Order')  # manual fix
            ==> this is the only issue - fixing it makes Behave run (with Security)
            Gen: OrderDetailList = relationship('OrderDetail', cascade_backrefs=False, backref='Order')
            Schema col defined as: OrderId INTEGER not null references "Order" on delete cascade,

        from sqlalchemy import Boolean, Column, DECIMAL, Date, Float, Double, ForeignKey, ForeignKeyConstraint, Integer, String, Table, Text, text
            GA:
                Order.Discount has no Double...  was Float in GA/RC2, Double in Gen
                from sqlalchemy import Boolean, Column, DECIMAL, Date, Float, ForeignKey, ForeignKeyConstraint, Integer, String, Table, Text, text
                It's DOUBLE in the database, but reported differently in _get_adapted_type - wrong coltype class
                    GA meta reporting it FLOAT, Gen reporting in DOUBLE
                    Gen was seeing SQLiteDialect...
                    Gen actually seems right, maybe its innocuous
                        FIXME - ignore for now

        Manually apply these, and Behave runs

    Gen creating VARCHAR instead of String - fixed

    Creation log: Excluded single field fl on Order.Country

    Several pip freeze differences
    
        gen is newer -- safrs using "latest" versions?
